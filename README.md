# Machine-learning
I have practised K nearest neighbour classification model and trained a dataset of telecommunication line  to predict the category of customers, and evaluate the accuracy of your model.
In the second IBM FILE I will use this classification algorithm to build a model from the historical data of patients, and their response to different medications. Then you will use the trained decision tree to predict the class of an unknown patient, or to find a proper drug for a new patient.
